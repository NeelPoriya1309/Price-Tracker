However, all these premium materials contribute to the 234g weight. The back has a 1.1-inch OLED display which can be used to show the battery level, notifications, or even use it as a viewfinder in the camera app. The main display on the Mi 11 Ultra is easily one of the best out there. HDR videos look good when played locally or even on YouTube. Heavy titles such as Call of Duty: Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends ran smoothly without skipping a beat. Actual battery life was more than satisfactory during the review period. The areas in which this phone does excel include its excellent build quality, the vivid high-refresh-rate display, all-day battery life, and the very good set of cameras. The relatively spam-free MIUI experience is also refreshing.",
