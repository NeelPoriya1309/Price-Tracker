  "The history of our hotel It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose.

  "Do the big stuff. All day long. MacBook Air lasts up to an incredible 12 hours per charge. So you can work with it from breakfast to the end of the day without having to plug it in. If you want to sit back and relax, you can watch up to 12 hours of iTunes movies. And with up to 30 days on standby, you can even take several weeks off and then pick up where you left off. Thin. Easy. Powerful. And ready for anything. Whatever the task, the Intel Core i5 and i7 5th generation processors with Intel HD Graphics 6000 are up to it. Everything goes incredibly fast, whether you're editing photos or surfing the web. All the power comes in a 1.7cm thin unibody design that weighs just 1.35 kg. 802.11ac WLAN. Wireless. Effortless. If you connect directly to an 802.11ac base station like the AirPort Extreme or the AirPort Time Capsule, you'll experience up to 3x faster WLAN than with the previous generation. And 802.11ac is not only faster, it also has more range. So you have more options. SSD memory. And it runs. The SSD memory in MacBook Air is up to 17x faster than a 5400-rpm hard drive. It's all smoother and more responsive. And thanks to SSD memory and fifth-generation Intel Core processors, MacBook Air wakes up extremely quickly from sleep. macOS macOS is the operating system behind everything you do on a Mac. macOS Sierra brings Siri to the Mac - and new ways to experience your photos and work more seamlessly across multiple devices.",
